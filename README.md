# Betwixt

Betwixt is an application that allows you find places of interest around the mid point between two locations.

## Basic Usage

Enter in two different addresses in the "First Location" and "Second Location" fields, something you want to find in the area (i.e. pizza, coffee, movies) in the "Point of Interest" field, select your mode of travel, then click "SUBMIT".

You will be directed to next page which will contain a Google Map with markers for the midpoint and points of interest as well as a section to view more information on the points of interest.
